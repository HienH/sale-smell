📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: Sale-Smell
Version: MVP v1
Prepared by: ChatGPT
Date: July 9, 2025

🔥 Product Summary
Sale-Smell is a web AI tool that allows users to upload recorded sales calls and receive intelligent, actionable feedback. By combining speech-to-text transcription (via AssemblyAI) with a local LLM (LLaMA 3 via Ollama), the app provides sales coaching insights, sentiment analysis, and structured call metrics. Users can download a detailed PDF report based on the analysis.

🎯 Goals
Help sales reps improve by analyzing real sales conversations.

Automatically transcribe, summarize, and assess call quality.

Surface coaching insights: tone, objection handling, talk ratio, etc.

Deliver a downloadable coaching report.

Keep the app lightweight and frictionless: no login required for MVP.

🧑‍💻 Target Users
Individual sales reps

SDRs and AEs doing outbound or inbound calls

Sales coaches and team leads (future version)

🔮 Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
As Sale-Smell scales to production and supports real users across the web, we plan to move beyond local LLaMA 3 (via Ollama) and adopt a more powerful, cloud-hosted or GPU-deployable LLM such as
 Mistral 7B Instruct on Together.ai 


🏗️ Planned Migration Steps
Keep using Ollama + LLaMA 3 for local development & prototyping

Add support for Together.ai API in backend (via environment flag)

Benchmark Mixtral vs LLaMA 3 / 70B output for quality and speed
